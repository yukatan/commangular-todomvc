# AngularJS TodoMVC Example Rewritten with Commangular


## Implementation
This is the TodoMVC implemetation example for angularJS re-architected with Commangular. The example from TodoMVC is doing almost all the stuff in the controller, with Commangular the code is moved to the infrastructure layer and divided into commands. For small applications commangular looks some over-engineering and sure it is. It fits better on medium big applications, but it shows perfect how Commangular works.
